# Strategic Pivot: Parasite Diagnostic Quiz

## Copywriter Feedback Implemented ✅

**Original Feedback:**
> "Remove the 'new years sale' badge, it makes me feel like I'm gonna be sold something. Change the headline to: Bloating, Brain Fog and Stubborn fat? You might have a parasite! Take this doctor approved quiz to find out. The quiz focuses on bloating etc which is good, but really doesn't give them a sense that its a parasite that's hurting them or causing it. Quizzes with a good reason for someone to take it to get a 'diagnoses' of their problem tend to do better like the Vshred 'do you know your body type' or Upwellness 'what's your liver metabolic type?'"

## Strategic Positioning Change

### Before: General Wellness Quiz
- Focus: Multiple health concerns (bloating, fatigue, blood pressure)
- Villain: Vague "toxins" and "inflammation"
- Outcome: General wellness plan
- Appeal: Broad but unfocused

### After: Parasite Diagnostic Quiz
- Focus: Clear diagnostic - "Do you have parasites?"
- Villain: Specific - Parasites (3.5 billion people affected)
- Outcome: Parasite cleanse protocol
- Appeal: Diagnostic curiosity + clear solution
